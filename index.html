        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>
            Since the invention of the first aeroplane, many engineers have been finding ways to improve the structure of aeroplanes and aircraft in general. 
            This paper examines discoveries made by engineers and the outcomes of applying these ideas. The paper is divided into four main sections: drag, 
            weight, thrust, and lift. In each section, an idea is discussed on how the structure of an aircraft can be optimized, such as angling plane wings 
            to generate more lift force.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Since the invention of the aeroplane, engineers have continuously worked to improve aircraft design to achieve remarkable advancements. 
                These efforts have led to the development of aircraft like the Concorde, the first commercial aeroplane to surpass the speed of sound, 
                reaching 2,158 km/h (Bushnell, 2024). Fighter jets such as the North American X-15 and MiG-25 Foxbat reached speeds of 7,274 km/h and 
                3,000 km/h, respectively (Mubarak and Tide, 2024). Such achievements are grounded in the principles of aerodynamics, which this paper explores 
                in detail.

                <h3>Drag</h3>
                <p>
                    Drag is a significant force that hinders an aircraft's acceleration, especially at high speeds. Engineers have investigated advanced materials 
                    and structural designs to combat drag. For example, riblets with symmetric V-grooves manufactured by 3M have been widely studied and shown to 
                    offer consistent drag reduction (Mubarak and Tide, 2024, p. 237). Figure 1 illustrates the optimized design of these V-grooves.

                    Another approach is Laminar Flow Control (LFC), which aims to streamline aircraft surfaces. This method delays the transition from laminar 
                    to turbulent flow using either natural pressure gradients or active suction techniques (Bushnell, 2024, p. 15). These strategies significantly 
                    enhance aircraft performance and fuel efficiency.

            <article id="weight">
                <h3>Weight</h3>
                <p>
                    Aircraft weight plays a critical role in fuel efficiency, as heavier planes require more energy to achieve lift. Engineers have proposed using 
                    composite materials to optimize weight distribution in aircraft wings. For instance, the use of composites in high-aspect-ratio wings reduces 
                    weight significantly (Sinha et al., 2024, p. 310). Figure 2 shows the structural optimization of such wings.

            <article id="thrust">
                <h3>Thrust</h3>
                <p>
                    Thrust, the forward-driving force of an aircraft, can be optimized by redesigning engines and using advanced materials. For example, thermal 
                    barrier coatings (TBCs) consisting of ceramic layers with low thermal conductivity enhance engine performance by reducing cooling airflow 
                    (Leyens, 2024). This innovation allows engines to achieve higher thrust with greater efficiency.

            <article id="lift">
                <h3>Lift</h3>
                <p>
                    Lift enables aircraft to overcome weight and achieve flight. This force is generated by the pressure difference between the upper and lower 
                    surfaces of the wing. Angled wings create a larger velocity on the upper surface, resulting in positive lift (Liu, 2024). Such designs are 
                    fundamental to modern aircraft mechanics and efficiency.
