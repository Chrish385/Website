   <h3>Abstract</h3>
   <p>Since the invention of the first aeroplane many engineers have been finding ways on 
      how we can improve the structure on aeroplanes and aircrafts in general. This paper is 
      designed to look into what discoveries some engineers have made and what the result
      of using these  concept ideas were. The paper is divided into 4 main sections : drag ,
      weight, thrust and lift. In each section , an idea has been covered on how we could
      change the structure of an aircraft, like making the wings on a plane more angled to 
      get a life force from the plane.</p>
