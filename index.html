    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>Since the invention of the first aeroplane, many engineers have been finding ways to improve the structure of aeroplanes and aircrafts in general. This paper looks into what discoveries some engineers have made and the results of using these concept ideas. The paper is divided into four main sections: drag, weight, thrust, and lift. In each section, an idea on how to change the structure of an aircraft, like making the wings more angled to get a lift force, is covered.</p>
    <h3>Main article</h3>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Since the invention of the aeroplane, many engineers have tried to find more effective ways to change the design of aircrafts to achieve extraordinary feats. Because of these changes, we were able to create aircrafts like the Concorde, the first commercial aeroplane able to surpass the sound barrier, reaching a speed of 2,158 km/h, and fighter jets like the North American X-15 and MiG-25 Foxbat, reaching speeds of 7,274 km/h and 3,000 km/h respectively. Engineers achieved these speeds with an understanding of aerodynamics. This paper helps to understand how these engineers used aerodynamics to aid in aircraft design.</p>
    <h4>Content</h4>
    <h4>Drag</h4>
    <p>One main issue in trying to get planes to high speeds is drag force, which hinders acceleration. Engineers have formulated the concept of using advanced materials and changing the structural design of aircraft to combat this. This concept is further studied in the paper “Review on the Drag Reduction Technologies in Aircraft” by A.K. Mubarak and P.S. Tide. The authors explain overcoming the drag force by using “riblets with symmetric v-grooves with adhesive-backed film manufactured by the 3M company (USA). The results showed consistency in drag reduction and flow structure aspects.” Another concept explored is Laminar Flow Control (LFC), reducing drag by streamlining the aircraft. The paper “Aircraft Drag Reduction—a Review” by D.M. Bushnell states, “(LFC), with ‘natural’ laminar flow defined by pressure gradient-controlled/delayed transition and ‘forced’ or active laminar flow obtained via suction. This technology offered large gains in aircraft performance and was actively pursued in various countries.”</p>
    <h4>Weight</h4>
    <p>Although the weight of the aircraft may seem insignificant compared to other factors like thrust and lift, it can cause issues like higher fuel usage, as more energy is needed to lift a heavier plane. Engineers have proposed changing the wing's structure to reduce weight. In the paper "Loads Analysis and Structural Optimization of a High Aspect Ratio, Composite Wing Aircraft," they tried to change the weight distribution of the wing. “A significant amount of weight reduction is observable when using composite materials for the primary structure.” The structure of the wing and redistributing the weight can help with fuel efficiency.</p>
    <h4>Thrust</h4>
    <p>Thrust is the driving force generated by the aircraft’s engines. To help aircraft reach high speeds, engineers focus on maximizing thrust force after lift-off, often by changing the engine design and using advanced materials. The article "Advanced Materials and Coatings for Future Gas Turbine Applications" by Christoph Leyens references a material known as TBC, consisting of thin ceramic layers with low thermal conductivity, enabling increased engine performance/thrust by either increasing gas temperature or reducing cooling air flow.</p>
    <h4>Lift</h4>
    <p>Lift opposes the weight of the aircraft, enabling it to fly. Engineers design wings to generate lift by angling them to produce vertical upward force and horizontal force. The paper "Evolutionary Understanding of Airfoil Lift" by Tianshu Liu explains, “When velocity at the upper surface is larger than at the lower surface, the pressure difference generates positive lift.” Angling the wing is vital to the plane's mechanics.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Aerodynamics plays a pivotal role in the design and performance of modern aircraft. By breaking down the fundamental forces, we can see how aircraft may implement features to comply with aerodynamics, like lighter, angled wings. Ongoing research into more effective aircraft design will drive innovation, making aircraft safer and more capable.</p>
