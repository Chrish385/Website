   <h3>Abstract</h3>
   <p>Since the invention of the first aeroplane many engineers have been finding ways on ;
      how we can improve the structure on aeroplanes and aircrafts in general. This paper is 
      designed to look into what discoveries some engineers have made and what the result
      of using these  concept ideas were. The paper is divided into 4 main sections : drag ,
      weight, thrust and lift. In each section , an idea has been covered on how we could
      change the structure of an aircraft, like making the wings on a plane more angled to 
      get a life force from the plane.</p>

   <h4>Introduction</h4>
   <p>Since the invention of the aeroplane, many engineers have tried to find more effective ways to help change the design of the aircraft such that it can extraordinary achievements . Because of these changes we were able to create such aircrafts like the Concorde, the first commercial aeroplane that was able to surpass sound, reaching a speed of 2,158 km/h. We were also able to make fighter jets like North American x-15 and MiG – 25 Foxbat, which were able to reach speeds like 7274km/h and 3000km/h. Engineers were able to make aircrafts reach speeds with the understanding on how aerodynamics works. This paper is designed to help understand how these engineers were able to aerodynamics to help aid in the design in the aircraft. </p>
   <h4>content</h4>
   <h4>Drag</h4>
   <p>One main issue in trying to get planes to high speeds is the drag force, as it hinders the acceleration of the aircraft. Engineers have formulated the concept of using more advanced materials and changing the structural design of the aircraft to combat this. This concept is further studied in the paper “Review on the Drag Reduction Technologies in Aircraft” by A.K. Mubarak and P.S. Tide. The authors explain overcoming the drag force by using “riblets with symmetric v-grooves (height equal to spacing) with adhesive-backed film manufactured by the 3M company (USA) have been widely investigated” (Mubarak & Tide, 2024). The results showed “colossal consistency with regard to the degree of drag reduction as well as certain aspects of flow structure” (Mubarak & Tide, 2024). Figure 1 represents a virtual representation of the v-grooves. The design of the v-grooves is carefully optimized to provide optimal drag reduction. Another concept explored is Laminar Flow Control (LFC), which aims to reduce drag by streamlining the aircraft. The paper “Aircraft Drag Reduction—a Review” by D.M. Bushnell states, “(LFC), with ‘natural’ laminar flow defined by pressure gradient-controlled/delayed transition and ‘forced’ or active laminar flow obtained via suction. This technology offered large gains in aircraft performance and was actively pursued, at various times, in many countries” (Bushnell, 2024). LFC employs two main techniques to delay the transition from laminar to turbulent flow: natural laminar flow, which uses pressure gradients to control and delay transition, and active laminar flow, which uses suction to achieve the same effect. These methods significantly enhance aircraft performance and have been widely researched globally.</p>

   <h4>weight</h4>
   <p>Even though the weight of the aircraft may seem insignificant compared to other factors like thrust and lift, it can still cause issues like higher fuel usage, as more energy is needed to lift a heavier plane. Engineers have proposed the idea of changing the wing's structure to reduce weight. In the paper "Loads Analysis and Structural Optimization of a High Aspect Ratio, Composite Wing Aircraft", they tried to change the weight distribution of the wing. “A significant amount of weight reduction is observable when using composite materials for the primary structure” (Sinha et al., 2024). Figure 2 shows a diagram of how the wing is structured. The structure of the wing and redistributing the weight can help the aircraft with other factors like fuel efficiency.</p>
   <h4>Thrust</h4>
   <p>Thrust is the driving force generated by the aircraft’s engines. As engineers, to help aircraft reach high speeds, we need to maximize the thrust force experienced by the aircraft after lift-off. One main idea most engineers focus on is changing the entire engine's design. Some ideas engineers keep in mind when changing the engine design include using more advanced materials. Using advanced materials helps increase the force of thrust as less energy is needed. The article "Advanced Materials and Coatings for Future Gas Turbine Applications" by Christoph Leyens references a material known as TBC which “consist of thin ceramic layers of low thermal conductivity - typically partially stabilized zirconia - which are applied on aerofoil surfaces that just have a metallic corrosion resistant coating.” Leyens (2024) states, “Application of the TBCs enables increasing engine performance/thrust by either increasing the gas temperature or reducing the cooling air flow.” Overall, we could use more advanced materials like TBC so that we can make aircraft reach high speeds as less energy is needed to move the aircraft</p>
   <h4>Lift</h4>
   <p>The lift force opposes the weight of the aircraft, enabling it to fly. Engineers have designed most aircraft to use wings to create lift. This is done by angling the wing so that when in contact with the wind, it generates a vertical upward force and a horizontal force. The paper "Evolutionary Understanding of Airfoil Lift" by Tianshu Liu explains this concept, stating that “When velocity at the upper surface is larger than that at the lower surface, the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces generates positive lift in the upward direction” (Liu, 2024). Therefore, keeping the wing at an angle is a vital part of the plane's mechanics.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>Aero dynamics provides  a pivotal role in design and performance of a modern aircraft. By breaking down how most aircrafts a designed by the fundamental forces, we could how an aircraft my implement certain features to comply with the aerodynamics. Like making the wings lighter and angled. Reaserch into finding more effective ways to make aircrafts more efficient will continue to drive innovation, making aircraft safer and more capable.</p>
