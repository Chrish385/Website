        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>
            Since the invention of the first aeroplane, many engineers have been finding ways to improve the structure of aeroplanes and aircraft in general. 
            This paper is designed to look into what discoveries some engineers have made and the results of using these concept ideas. 
            The paper is divided into 4 main sections: drag, weight, thrust, and lift. In each section, an idea has been covered on how we could change the 
            structure of an aircraft, like making the wings on a plane more angled to get a lift force from the plane.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Since the invention of the aeroplane, many engineers have tried to find more effective ways to help change the design of the aircraft such 
                that it can achieve extraordinary achievements. Because of these changes, we were able to create such aircraft as the Concorde, the first 
                commercial aeroplane that was able to surpass sound, reaching a speed of 2,158 km/h. We were also able to make fighter jets like the 
                North American X-15 and MiG-25 Foxbat, which reached speeds like 7,274 km/h and 3,000 km/h. Engineers were able to make aircraft reach 
                such speeds with the understanding of how aerodynamics works. This paper is designed to help understand how these engineers used aerodynamics 
                to aid in aircraft design.

            <article id="drag">
                <h3>Drag</h3>
                <p>
                    One main issue in trying to get planes to high speeds is the drag force, as it hinders the acceleration of the aircraft. Engineers have 
                    formulated the concept of using more advanced materials and changing the structural design of the aircraft to combat this. This concept is 
                    further studied in the paper 
                    <em>“Review on the Drag Reduction Technologies in Aircraft”</em> by A.K. Mubarak and P.S. Tide. The authors explain overcoming the drag 
                    force by using 
                    “riblets with symmetric v-grooves (height equal to spacing) with adhesive-backed film manufactured by the 3M company (USA) have been widely 
                    investigated” (Mubarak & Tide, 2024). The results showed “colossal consistency with regard to the degree of drag reduction as well as 
                    certain aspects of flow structure” (Mubarak & Tide, 2024).

                <p>
                    Another concept explored is Laminar Flow Control (LFC), which aims to reduce drag by streamlining the aircraft. The paper 
                    <em>“Aircraft Drag Reduction—a Review”</em> by D.M. Bushnell states, 
                    “(LFC), with ‘natural’ laminar flow defined by pressure gradient-controlled/delayed transition and ‘forced’ or active laminar flow obtained 
                    via suction. This technology offered large gains in aircraft performance and was actively pursued, at various times, in many countries” 
                    (Bushnell, 2024). LFC employs two main techniques to delay the transition from laminar to turbulent flow: natural laminar flow, which uses 
                    pressure gradients to control and delay transition, and active laminar flow, which uses suction to achieve the same effect.

            <article id="weight">
                <h3>Weight</h3>
                <p>
                    Even though the weight of the aircraft may seem insignificant compared to other factors like thrust and lift, it can still cause issues like 
                    higher fuel usage, as more energy is needed to lift a heavier plane. Engineers have proposed the idea of changing the wing's structure to 
                    reduce weight. In the paper 
                    <em>“Loads Analysis and Structural Optimization of a High Aspect Ratio, Composite Wing Aircraft”</em>, they tried to change the weight 
                    distribution of the wing. “A significant amount of weight reduction is observable when using composite materials for the primary structure” 
                    (Sinha et al., 2024).

                <p>
                    The structure of the wing and redistributing the weight can help the aircraft with other factors like fuel efficiency.

            <article id="thrust">
                <h3>Thrust</h3>
                <p>
                    Thrust is the driving force generated by the aircraft’s engines. To help aircraft reach high speeds, engineers need to maximize the thrust 
                    force experienced by the aircraft after lift-off. One main idea most engineers focus on is changing the entire engine's design. Some ideas 
                    engineers keep in mind when changing the engine design include using more advanced materials. Using advanced materials helps increase the 
                    force of thrust as less energy is needed. The article 
                    <em>“Advanced Materials and Coatings for Future Gas Turbine Applications”</em> by Christoph Leyens references a material known as TBC which 
                    “consist of thin ceramic layers of low thermal conductivity - typically partially stabilized zirconia - which are applied on aerofoil surfaces 
                    that just have a metallic corrosion resistant coating.” Leyens (2024) states, 
                    “Application of the TBCs enables increasing engine performance/thrust by either increasing the gas temperature or reducing the cooling air flow.” 
                    Overall, advanced materials like TBC allow aircraft to reach high speeds with reduced energy requirements.

            <article id="lift">
                <h3>Lift</h3>
                <p>
                    The lift force opposes the weight of the aircraft, enabling it to fly. Engineers have designed most aircraft to use wings to create lift. 
                    This is done by angling the wing so that when in contact with the wind, it generates a vertical upward force and a horizontal force. The paper 
                    <em>“Evolutionary Understanding of Airfoil Lift”</em> by Tianshu Liu explains this concept, stating that 
                    “When velocity at the upper surface is larger than that at the lower surface, the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces 
                    generates positive lift in the upward direction” (Liu, 2024). Therefore, keeping the wing at an angle is a vital part of the plane's mechanics.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Aerodynamics plays a pivotal role in the design and performance of modern aircraft. By breaking down how most aircraft are designed by the 
                fundamental forces, we can see how an aircraft might implement certain features to comply with aerodynamics, like making the wings lighter and 
                angled. Research into finding more effective ways to make aircraft more efficient will continue to drive innovation, making aircraft safer and 
                more capable.
