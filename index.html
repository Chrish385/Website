   <h3>Abstract</h3>
   <p>Since the invention of the first aeroplane many engineers have been finding ways on 
      how we can improve the structure on aeroplanes and aircrafts in general. This paper is 
      designed to look into what discoveries some engineers have made and what the result
      of using these  concept ideas were. The paper is divided into 4 main sections : drag ,
      weight, thrust and lift. In each section , an idea has been covered on how we could
      change the structure of an aircraft, like making the wings on a plane more angled to 
      get a life force from the plane.</p>

   <h4>Introduction</h4>
   <p>Since the invention of the aeroplane, many engineers have tried to find more effective ways to help change the design of the aircraft such that it can extraordinary achievements . Because of these changes we were able to create such aircrafts like the Concorde, the first commercial aeroplane that was able to surpass sound, reaching a speed of 2,158 km/h. We were also able to make fighter jets like North American x-15 and MiG – 25 Foxbat, which were able to reach speeds like 7274km/h and 3000km/h. Engineers were able to make aircrafts reach speeds with the understanding on how aerodynamics works. This paper is designed to help understand how these engineers were able to aerodynamics to help aid in the design in the aircraft. </p>

   <h4>Drag</h4>
   <p>One main issue in trying to get planes to high speeds is the drag force, as it hinders the acceleration of the aircraft. Engineers have formulated the concept of using more advanced materials and changing the structural design of the aircraft to combat this. This concept is further studied in the paper “Review on the Drag Reduction Technologies in Aircraft” by A.K. Mubarak and P.S. Tide. The authors explain overcoming the drag force by using “riblets with symmetric v-grooves (height equal to spacing) with adhesive-backed film manufactured by the 3M company (USA) have been widely investigated” (Mubarak & Tide, 2024). The results showed “colossal consistency with regard to the degree of drag reduction as well as certain aspects of flow structure” (Mubarak & Tide, 2024). Figure 1 represents a virtual representation of the v-grooves. The design of the v-grooves is carefully optimized to provide optimal drag reduction. Another concept explored is Laminar Flow Control (LFC), which aims to reduce drag by streamlining the aircraft. The paper “Aircraft Drag Reduction—a Review” by D.M. Bushnell states, “(LFC), with ‘natural’ laminar flow defined by pressure gradient-controlled/delayed transition and ‘forced’ or active laminar flow obtained via suction. This technology offered large gains in aircraft performance and was actively pursued, at various times, in many countries” (Bushnell, 2024). LFC employs two main techniques to delay the transition from laminar to turbulent flow: natural laminar flow, which uses pressure gradients to control and delay transition, and active laminar flow, which uses suction to achieve the same effect. These methods significantly enhance aircraft performance and have been widely researched globally.</p>
